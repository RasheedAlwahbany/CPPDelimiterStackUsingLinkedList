# C++ Dilimeter Stack Using Linked List
this is C++ dilimeter stack using linked list

# What is C++
C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

# What is Stack
A stack is an array or list structure of function calls and parameters used in modern computer programming and CPU architecture. Similar to a stack of plates at a buffet restaurant or cafeteria, elements in a stack are added or removed from the top of the stack, in a “last in first, first out” or LIFO order.

# What is Linked List
In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

# What is Dilimeter Stack
The common application of Stack is delimiter checking, i.e., parsing that involves analyzing a source program syntactically. It is also called parenthesis checking. When the compiler translates a source program written in some programming language such as C, C++ to a machine language, it parses the program into multiple individual parts such as variable names, keywords, etc. By scanning from left to right. The main problem encountered while translating is the unmatched delimiters. We make use of different types of delimiters include the parenthesis checking (,), curly braces {,} and square brackets [,], and common delimiters /* and */. Every opening delimiter must match a closing delimiter, i.e., every opening parenthesis should be followed by a matching closing parenthesis. Also, the delimiter can be nested. The opening delimiter that occurs later in the source program should be closed before those occurring earlier.
